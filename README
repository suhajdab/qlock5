An html remake of the most awesome clock I've ever seen: qlocktwo ( http://www.qlocktwo.com ). Original design by Biegert & Funk.

2012-04-03
Added simple customization for users. Simply add an #option to change default behaviour.

Supported hashtags:
#nofooter - hides footer ( great when using qlock5 as a screensaver )
#black-ice-tea, #cherry-cake, #frozen-blackberry, #lime-juice - set a fixed theme ( disables hourly change )

One can also combine a theme with nofooter, by comma seperating tags.
Ex: 
 http://qlock5.nu/#nofooter,cherry-cake 
 will give you the red theme and hide the footer
